Shared memory driver implements HAL memory allocation and deallocation operations and affiliated functions.

Symbols created by this package are part of **Runtime**.

== Distribution

*   **shmem_api:** Memory maps (`mmap`) shared memory intro process space
-   Use either **shmem_driver_module** allocated memory or allocates a new block via standard Linux system calls

*   **shmem_driver_module**: Allocate memory for Machinekit-HAL functionality in kernelspace
-   Ability to allocate memory for multiple instances at once (as there cannot be multiple instances of single kernel module)
-   Currently not __used__ and __build__

WARNING: **shmem_driver_module** is meant to be a **Kernel module**. Linux kernel modules are special pieces of sofware with its own set of rules. One of them is that the module **needs to be build for each kernel separately**.

== CMAKE targets

Objects created in `CMAKE` Machinekit-HAL's namespace used for building.

=== shmem_api (`SHARED` library)
*   Standard shared library used for compile time linking into binaries
*   Transitively exports **PUBLIC** interface header files through transitive dependencies

**This is ungly and hopefully temporary solution. For long-term solution decision needs to be made on the Linux kernel module driver.**
