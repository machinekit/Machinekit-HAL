Misc_gtk is a library used in graphical parts of Machinekit-HAL like HALscope and HAL meter. Thus, should be a terporary as Machinekit-HAL is intended as mainly headless solution.

-   Doesn't need to support real-time execution, can include code sleeping, yielding or otherwise breaking __real-time__

== CMAKE targets

Objects created in `CMAKE` Machinekit-HAL's namespace used for building.

=== misc_gtk (`libmisc_gtk.so`)
