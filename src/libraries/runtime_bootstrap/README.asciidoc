Runtime-bootstrap experts exports the core functionality for build workflow of Machinekit-HAL. To use during the main build and also in out-of-tree build of additional functionality (related libraries, executables and HAL modules).

== Distribution

*   **runtime_config:** Statically linked into libraries and executables including the `config.h` header file

== CMAKE targets

Objects created in `CMAKE` Machinekit-HAL's namespace used for building.

=== runtime_config (`STATIC` library)
*   Isolates the `VERSION` and `MACHINEKIT_HAL_GIT_BUILD_SHA` into separate library statically linked to functional libraries, thus eliminatin constly build step on each commit

== Notes

* Possibility to further split this package into `runtime_config` et all.
