Runtime export the basic API for Machinekit-HAL function. It provides the lowest lewel set of symbols and has to be loaded first.

== Distribution

*   **rtapi_module:** Dynamically loaded (`dl_open`) module into managed namespace
-   Supports real-time execution
-   Compiled with `RTAPI` flag __DEFINE__
*   **ulapi**: Shared library used to link into executables and other shared libraries
-   Doesn't need to support real-time execution, can include code sleeping, yielding or otherwise breaking __real-time__
-   Compiled with `ULAPI` flag __DEFINE__

== CMAKE targets

Objects created in `CMAKE` Machinekit-HAL's namespace used for building.

=== runtime_api (`INTERFACE` library)
*   Fully abstract `CMAKE` object with no output representation
*   Used for propagation of **interface** headers to depending modules

=== runtime_module (`rtapi_module.so`)
*   **MODULE** dynamically loaded into linked namespace
*   Many of the symbols will be resolved at runtime from modules loaded beforehand (as per `RTLD_GLOBAL`)
*   Not intended for `target_link_libraries()` use

=== runtime (`libulapi.so`)
*   Standard shared library used for compile time linking into binaries
*   Transitively exports **PUBLIC** interface header files through transitive dependencies
