Temporary solution for sharing single sourcefile between multiple `CMAKE` targets. Should go away once executables can be linked against **runtime** (`libulapi.so`) without its symbols infusing the managed linker namespace (where **runtime_module** [`rtapi_module.so`] is loaded).

== CMAKE targets

Objects created in `CMAKE` Machinekit-HAL's namespace used for building.

=== rtapi_compat (`INTERFACE` library)
*   Fully abstract `CMAKE` object with no output representation
*   Used for adding sourcefiles to multiple other targets (executables) with the same compile options
*   Compile once, use multiple times

**This is ungly and hopefully temporary solution. In perfect world it would not be needed. But we don't live in perfect world.**
